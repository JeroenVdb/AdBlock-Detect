# Detect if a user is using an AdBlocker

I like this approach for detecting an AdBlocker because it doesn't involve making fake 'ads.js' requests.

### Compatibility

| Browser | Compatible |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Chrome + uBlock | OK |
| Chrome + AdBlock | ? |
| Chrome + AdBlock Plus | ? |
| Firefox + AdBlock | ? |
